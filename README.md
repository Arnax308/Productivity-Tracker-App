# Productivity-Tracker-App
I always wanted an app to simply track for how many continuous days I did something. Couldn't really find one, so made one.
Its an simple app, in which you can add tasks and if you did the task you can just marked it as done. Likewise if not done, you mark it as not done.
Your progress or streak is saved in an txt file. It also shows you your streak. Basically if you have been doing a task for lets say 3 days, it will tell you that your streak is 3 days.
Streaks reset the moment you mark a task as not done. 

I consider this an great productive tool, as you can track your consistency.
